## React Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Use React.memo()** - Memoize components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. **Code Splitting** - Implement dynamic imports with React.lazy() and Suspense
3. **Virtualize Long Lists** - Use libraries like react-window for efficient rendering
4. **Optimize Images** - Use next/image for automatic image optimization
5. **Avoid Inline Function Definitions** - Define functions outside the render method

## TypeScript Best Practices

1. **Use Strict Mode** - Enable strict type checking in tsconfig.json
2. **Leverage Type Inference** - Let TypeScript infer types when possible
3. **Use Utility Types** - Master built-in types like Pick, Omit, and Partial
4. **Create Custom Type Guards** - Improve type safety with type predicates
5. **Avoid 'any' Type** - Be as specific as possible with your types

## AI Integration Tips

1. **Start with Pre-trained Models** - Leverage models from Hugging Face or OpenAI
2. **Optimize API Calls** - Implement caching and rate limiting
3. **Handle Errors Gracefully** - Provide fallbacks for AI service failures
4. **Monitor Performance** - Track latency and success rates of AI features
5. **Consider Edge Cases** - Plan for unexpected or inappropriate AI responses

## DevOps & Deployment

1. **Containerize Your Apps** - Use Docker for consistent environments
2. **Implement CI/CD** - Automate testing and deployment pipelines
3. **Monitor Application Health** - Set up logging and monitoring
4. **Use Infrastructure as Code** - Manage infrastructure with Terraform or Pulumi
5. **Implement Blue-Green Deployments** - Minimize downtime during updates

## Career Growth

1. **Contribute to Open Source** - Build your portfolio and collaborate with others
2. **Write Technical Blog Posts** - Document your learning journey
3. **Attend Meetups & Conferences** - Network with other professionals
4. **Learn in Public** - Share your projects and progress online
5. **Mentor Others** - Teaching is one of the best ways to learn
